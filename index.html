        <h3>Barbell workout</h3>

        <p>
          Barbells are a valuable tool in the arsenal of a person who wants to gain strength efficiently and safely.
          Increasing the weight gradually over a period of time will tear down muscle tissue and then rebuild it,
          ultimately making you stronger. Because you add weight progressively with free weights, you don't have
          to add repetitions and lengthen your workout. Exercise experts also point to several other benefits of barbells.
